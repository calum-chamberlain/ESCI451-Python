    "\n",
    "1. **Doing dull things manually is boring**: You, a highly trained scientist, should be doing something more worthwhile than moving decimal points in spreadsheets;\n",
    "2. **Reproducibility**: someone should be able to take what you have done and re-do it, without your \"fudging\". The more your \"expert opinion\" is used to generate a result, the less trust-worthy that result is.\n",
    "3. **Safety**: you will cock something up (likely many things, that is what learning is about) while doing your science; if you write a program to do the thing, and write it well, you should just have to make minor adjustments to fix the issue and re-run it, rather than having to re-do all the boring work (see 1).\n",
