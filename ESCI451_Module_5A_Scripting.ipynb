    "These notebooks have been developed by Calum Chamberlain, Finnigan Illsley-Kemp and John Townend at [Victoria University of Wellington-Te Herenga Waka](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz) for use by Earth Science graduate students. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks cover material that we think will be of particular benefit to those students with little or no previous experience of computer-based data analysis. We presume very little background in command-line or code-based computing, and have compiled this material with an emphasis on general tasks that a grad student might encounter on a daily basis. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2022, this material will be delivered at the start of Trimester 1 in conjunction with [ESCI451 Active Earth](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/courses/esci/451/2022/offering?crn=32176). Space and pandemic alert levels permitting, interested students not enrolled in ESCI451 are encouraged to come along too but please contact Calum, Finn, or John first.\n",

    "Most of the work we do in scientific programming is not done in notebooks. Notebooks are really helpful for teaching and disseminating information, but as you will have seen, you can run cells out of order resulting in some irreproducible workflows. Generally we write *scripts* that run a series of function calls in order, then save the result.\n",
