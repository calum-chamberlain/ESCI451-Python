    "The notebooks cover material that we think will be of particular benefit to those students with little or no previous experience of computer-based data analysis. We presume very little background in command-line or code-based computing, and have compiled this material with an emphasis on general tasks that a grad student might encounter on a daily basis. \n",

Space and pandemic alert levels permitting, interested students not enrolled in ESCI451 are encouraged to come along too but please contact Calum, Finn, or John first.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Doing dull things manually is boring**: You, a highly trained scientist, should be doing something more worthwhile than moving decimal points in spreadsheets;\n",
    "2. **Reproducibility**: someone should be able to take what you have done and re-do it, without your \"fudging\". The more your \"expert opinion\" is used to generate a result, the less trust-worthy that result is.\n",
    "3. **Safety**: you will cock something up (likely many things, that is what learning is about) while doing your science; if you write a program to do the thing, and write it well, you should just have to make minor adjustments to fix the issue and re-run it, rather than having to re-do all the boring work (see 1).\n",

The colon (`:`) at the end of the `for` line shows that that statement has finished.\n",

For those who haven't guessed it yet, this is the day of the [Dusky Sound earthquake](https://www.geonet.org.nz/earthquake/story/3124785).
