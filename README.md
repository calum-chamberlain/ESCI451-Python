# ESCI451-Python

Introduction to Python for VUW ESCI 451 course (Active Earth). Designed to be a 1-day workshop, 
first run in March 2020.

These notebooks aim to get students with no previous computing experience to a point where they can
automate simple data I/O and processing, as well as conduct some simple plotting.  These notebooks
do not aim to teach you the nuances of Python as a language, or any advanced ideas in Python.

The notebooks are as follows:

0. Introduction to Python; - why programming, reproducibility, keeping data and processing seperate.
1. Python logic - for loops and if statements;
2. Plotting data with matplotlib (1); - simple plotting of lists, required for visualisation of data later
3. Simple data IO and processing with Numpy; - read from text-file, slice, add, divide, etc.
4. Meta-data and data IO with Pandas; - read data from xls sheets, get someones dataset from them, play
5. Calculations with data; - Finn want's to think about uncertainty
6. Automation with functions; - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
7. Mini-project, get climate data and plot it and uncertainity - point students towards [this page](https://towardsdatascience.com/time-series-analysis-and-climate-change-7bb4371021e) for extensions.

## Getting started

To run these notebooks locally you will need to install the required Python packages. If you are taking
this as a course at VUW this should have been done for you.  Otherwise, install the required packages
listed in the `Requirements.txt` file.
