    "In this course we will be using the Python programming language to help us learn how to automate tasks in geoscience.\n",
    "Python is a relatively friendly language, but it still has lots of **rules** that you need to follow to make codes run.\n",
    "In the first three notebooks we will introduce some of those rules and start you on your way to \n",
    "[zen](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/).\n",
    "\n",
    "With that said, what follows is a very brief intro to Python for newcomers.  The focus of thess notebooks is to introduce you\n",
    "to the simple data types and logic in Python, and a couple of handy packages.  There are many other great tutorials out there \n",
    "for more in-depth ideas, e.g.\n",
    "- [The Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)\n",
    "- [LearnPython](https://www.learnpython.org/)\n",
    "- and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python itself is a useful language, but one of *the best* things about Python is all the packages written to extend\n",
    "Python.  These packages are usually distributed via [pypi](https://pypi.org) or/and [anaconda](https://conda.io), and are \n",
    "easy to install.  This means that you often don't have to write (much of) your own code! Most of the time someone out\n",
    "there knows better than you how to do something, so you get to use their code and focus on the important things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Python packages have documentation.  If you find yourself stuck, or thinking *I wish I could do this*, it is worth having\n",
    "a search online for what you want, or what you are stuck on.  With Python, installing other packages can be quite simple using\n",

    "\n",
    "## Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language (rather than a compiled language like Fortran or C). Because of this it is easy to\n",

    "the logic of your code. However, because of the interpreted nature of the language, Python is rarely the fastest\n",
    "choice. To combat this, Python can be (and has been) extended by compilled sections of code, meaning that time-critical\n",
    "sections of code can be sped-up.  This has led to quite a few libraries that use *Python as glue* to hold together\n",
    "faster sections of code written in C, fortran, or other languages. We will introduce one of these fast packages, *numpy*\n",
    "later: *numpy* is at the heart of almost all scientific Python applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python itself is open-source and runs almost anywhere, and is used for a whole range of purposes, from science\n",

    "other ways: You can interact with Python by running a Python shell - in MacOS or Linux systems, open a terminal and type\n",
    "`python3` to start a Python 3.x shell (the default Python on most systems is python 2.7, which\n",
    "is currently end-of-life, so best to start with Python 3). In windows, open the command line and\n",
