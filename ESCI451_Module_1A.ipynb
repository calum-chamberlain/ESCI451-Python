Space and pandemic alert levels permitting, interested students not enrolled in ESCI451 are encouraged to come along too but please contact Calum, Finn, or John first.\n",

You can interact with your code in a step-by-step way, so it is simple to understand the logic of your code. However, because of the interpreted nature of the language, Python is rarely the fastest choice. To combat this, Python can be (and has been) extended by compilled sections of code, meaning that time-critical sections of code can be sped-up.  This has led to quite a few libraries that use *Python as glue* to hold together faster sections of code written in C, fortran, or other languages.
