    "The notebooks cover material that we think will be of particular benefit to those students with little or no previous experience of computer-based data analysis. We presume very little background in command-line or code-based computing, and have compiled this material with an emphasis on general tasks that a grad student might encounter on a daily basis. \n",

Space and pandemic alert levels permitting, interested students not enrolled in ESCI451 are encouraged to come along too but please contact Calum, Finn, or John first.\n",

    "Much better, but there are lots of NaNs in there (Not a Number) where there is missing information for that cell. Some of these are because there actually isn't data, but some are there because there are merged cells in the spreadsheet. The default way Pandas handles this is to only assign the merged cell value to the first row of a multi-row merged cell. We really want that filled into both cells. To do with we can use the `.ffillna` method on the columns that we know have merged values. This is pretty messy, but this is often something that needs to be done to actually read in real data!"
