    "The notebooks cover material that we think will be of particular benefit to those students with little or no previous experience of computer-based data analysis. We presume very little background in command-line or code-based computing, and have compiled this material with an emphasis on general tasks that a grad student might encounter on a daily basis. \n",

There is a time and place for using Excel, but that time and place is rarely when doing data-intensive analyses: remember to keep your data sacred! Don't run the risk of overwriting your hard earned data, don't hide equations behind cells, and don't copy-and-paste (remember DRY).\n",

You can read all sorts with Pandas and apply all your new knowledge to your old data (yay!). To read Excel data we need to have installed an extra package (which is included in this environment already) called `openpyxl` - Pandas will call this under the hood to read Excel spreadsheets.\n",

Jenni and her team archived the data as excel tables in the supplement to this paper, as well as putting the data in proper databases like [PetLab](https://pet.gns.cri.nz/#/) and their submission to [EarthChem](https://ecl.earthchem.org/view.php?id=1724), although neither seems to offer a programmatic interface (correct me if I'm wrong). We will just use the supplementary data as a showcase of reading Excel data, and playing with formating.\n",

    "Much better, but there are lots of NaNs in there (Not a Number) where there is missing information for that cell. Some of these are because there actually isn't data, but some are there because there are merged cells in the spreadsheet. The default way Pandas handles this is to only assign the merged cell value to the first row of a multi-row merged cell. We really want that filled into both cells. To do with we can use the [`.ffill`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.ffill.html) method on the columns that we know have merged values. This is pretty messy, but this is often something that needs to be done to actually read in real data!"
