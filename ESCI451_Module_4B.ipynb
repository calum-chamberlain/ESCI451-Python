    "\n",
    "- [cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/) is the most \"pythonic\" map plotting library at the moment, and it is integrated with matplotlib in a way that PyGMT isn't. However, it can be painful with a lot of geospatial data. It is worth a look though and, if you are interested, we have some resources from previous years using caropty. \n",
    "- [bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) is pretty cool for creating interactive plots, including [maps](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/topics/geo.html) - CJC uses this quite a bit for interogating data.\n",
    "- [follium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium) looks nice for making interactive mapping plots - possibly better than bokeh because it is more focused on mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is all for now - hopefully that has given you some idea of how you can make some fairly nice plots without too much effort.  A key idea with these notebooks is for you to **borrow some code** from them so that you do not have to re-write everything yourself.\n",
