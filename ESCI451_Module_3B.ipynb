    "The notebooks cover material that we think will be of particular benefit to those students with little or no previous experience of computer-based data analysis. We presume very little background in command-line or code-based computing, and have compiled this material with an emphasis on general tasks that a grad student might encounter on a daily basis. \n",

Space and pandemic alert levels permitting, interested students not enrolled in ESCI451 are encouraged to come along too but please contact Calum, Finn, or John first.\n",
