We presume very little background in command-line or code-based computing, and have compiled this material with an emphasis on general tasks that a grad student might encounter on a daily basis. \n",

Space and pandemic alert levels permitting, interested students not enrolled in ESCI451 are encouraged to come along too but please contact Calum, Finn, or John first.\n",

Functions define a set block of code that takes some input and does something with it. Functions often return something, but they don't have to (they don't even need to take any input!).\n",

    "2. Reduce the risk of doing it wrong! Write it once, write it well and fix any bugs in that one bit of code!\n",

The whitespace (four spaces!) defines what content is within the function. You also need the brackets after `function_name` (you can call the function whatever you want - remember variable naming and name functions helpfully!) and the colon at the end of the brackets."
