Space and pandemic alert levels permitting, interested students not enrolled in ESCI451 are encouraged to come along too but please contact Calum, Finn, or John first.\n",

Functions define a set block of code that takes some input and does something with it. Functions often return something, but they don't have to (they don't even need to take any input!).\n",

    "2. Reduce the risk of doing it wrong! Write it once, write it well and fix any bugs in that one bit of code!\n",

The whitespace (four spaces!) defines what content is within the function. You also need the brackets after `function_name` (you can call the function whatever you want - remember variable naming and name functions helpfully!) and the colon at the end of the brackets."

    "Often it is handy to plot lines to mark key points on your graph - in this case we might want to mark the time of the Dusky Sound earthquake, and maybe the pre-earthquake position. Matplotlib has our back again with the [`.axhline`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.axhline.html) and [`.axvline`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.axvline.html) methods for horizontal and vertical lines respectively.\n",

    "Lets start off by marking the time of the Dusky Sound earthquake. GeoNet has this earthquakes origin time at 2009-07-15 09:22:29 UTC (you can see the UTC time in the [technical](https://www.geonet.org.nz/earthquake/technical/3124785) page for the earthquake). To plot that on our graph we need to create a [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) object, which is Python's way of handling the nuances of dates and time (leap years and seconds, adding and subtracting different time units etc.). We will talk more about `datetime` in one of the following notebooks."
