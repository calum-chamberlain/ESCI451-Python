Other DEMs are available - [LINZ has an 8m resolution DEM](https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/51768-nz-8m-digital-elevation-model-2012/), but it is 17GB...\n",

    "- [bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) is pretty cool for creating interactive plots, including [maps](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/geo.html) - CJC uses this quite a bit for interogating data.\n",
